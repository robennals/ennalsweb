<li>	Brie and Coloumbers taste exactly the same
<li>	French water isn't that bad after-all
<li>	All cheese becomes soft cheese when left in a pannier for a day
<li>	If you don't finish it, the ants will.
<li>	The French are very bad at signposting
</ul>		and not very good with toilets			
		as for signposting toilets... 
<p>
/[Simon - the signposts were frequent, but in regional languages. The maps were in French, The result, tricky. Still, as you've heard, we only got lost once...]
